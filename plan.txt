[x] Add food effects to snake (diff type)
    [x] Steroid cell - snake grows twice + scores goes twice + snake moves 1.5 faster, however if another steroid is not consumed in the next 15s the snake goes back -3, minimum is 1 cell, 
    [x] Creatine cell - snake grows for 1 + arms grow + speed goes up to 1.25. Since snake is hyped that it consumed creatine it goes reverse, so reverse linked list. Side effect: snake goes in reverse again . If snake is under the effect of steroid that it's immune to this effect. If snake has not consumed creatine in 15seconds it reverses again
    [x] Meat cell and Protein powder - snake grows for 1 
    [x] Implement timeout for each food

[] Design snake arms and effects
    [] Steroid cell - arms grow x1.5
    [] Creatine cell - arms grow x1.2
    [] Meat cell and Protein powder - arms grow x1.1

[] Design snake hair and hair fall effect
    [] Steroid cell - hair falls x2
    [] Creatine cell - if 5 creatines consumed in the last 50 seconds -> hair falls x1.2
    [] Meat cell and Protein powder - hair doesn't fall

[] Clean code

[] Add X style to effects that don't work because steroid effect > creatine effect

[] Bugs
    [] If snake is going right and up/down then left is clicked it will cancel game -> gameOver. That happens because the check is not correct inside useMovement and in my opinion the direction should be handles with useRef
