    [] Steroid cell - hair falls and snake grows twice + scores goes twice and snake moves 1.75 faster, however if another steroid is not consumed in the next 30s the snake goes back -3, minimum is 1 cell, 
    [] Creatine cell - snake grows for 1 + arms grow + speed goes up to 1.25. Since snake is hyped that it consumed creatine it goes reverse, so reverse linked list. Side effect: if 5 creatines consumed in the last 50 seconds -> hair falls
    [] Meat cell and Protein powder - snake grows for 1 + arms grow tiny bit
